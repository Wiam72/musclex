# Introduction

_This program is available on Muscle X version 1.7 or higher_

Image Merger is a program which is designed to be used with a series of images with sequential file names taken in a time resolved experiment. It averages a user-selected number of images in an input directory together and saves the new image in an output directory. It does this for the rest of the images in the input directory without user intervention. The user selects an input directory, the number of frames to average together and an output directory.
