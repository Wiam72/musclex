# Introduction

_This program is available on Muscle X version 1.16 or higher_

Add Intensities is a program which is designed to be used with a series of images placed across multiple folders. It takes the sum of the images in each folder which have the same number (For example, F_001.tif in Folder A will map to FP_001.tif in folder B). The matched images are then summed together and the resultant sum image is stored in ai results folder in the selected directory. The user selects an input directory, which contains multiple folders and images within them. After processing the images, a prompt is displayed which informs the user that the processing is completed.
