# Summary

Once the image is processed, the results of the analysis will be saved to a file called “summary.csv”. This summary file will be in the “eq_results” folder that is created as a sub-directory of the folder containing the selected file.

There is a second file created in "eq_results" named "summary2.csv". This file shows the same results but displayed in a different way: each image corresponds to one line, compared to summary.csv where each peak corresponds to one line (so multiple lines for one image).
