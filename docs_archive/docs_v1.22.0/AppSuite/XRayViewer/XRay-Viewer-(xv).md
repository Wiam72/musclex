# Introduction

During an experiment, it is often useful to quickly see the resulting h5 files to make sure that the diffraction is working properly. Opening it image by image can be painful and time consuming. That is why it is necessary to have a viewer able to quickly launch and display an image, and play through all he images like a video. Seeing a slice moving in real time can also be interesting to observe the peaks.

X-Ray Viewer is a small program used to display tif and h5 files and able to play images in a folder (or h5 file) as a video. A second tab shows a selected slice or an integrated slice of the image as a graph. The resulting graphs can be saved as a csv file in `xv_results`.

*This program is available on MuscleX version 1.21.0 or later.*
