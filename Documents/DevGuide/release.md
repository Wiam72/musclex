## Process outline
1. Create release tag and enter release notes on Github
2. Update DOI on Zenodo (If it was not done automaticly)  
3. Create pip distribution
4. Create docker distribution
5. Update documentation on Readthedocs
6. Create AppImage, Windows, and Mac standalone distributions and upload to Sourceforge (major releases only) 


## Prepare a Release
### Create a source distribution
Change the version string and any other things related in to this
release in `setup.py` and run
```
python setup.py sdist
```
You'll get a file `musclex-<version>.tar.gz` in folder `dist`. Check
if it can be properly installed with *pip* on different platforms.
```
pip install dist/musclex-<version>.tar.gz
```

### Create a Windows installer
1. [Create Stand-alone Program for Windows with PyInstaller][1]
2. [Make a Windows installer (MSI)][2]

> If any changes are made to the source code in the source distribution
  during these steps, check if they work in any previous sections.

### Create a Mac OS X App Bundle
New mac os installation no longer being produced, please use the docker version
1. [Create Stand-alone Program for Mac OS X with PyInstaller][1]
2. [Build a DMG Image or pkg file][3]

> If any changes are made to the source code in the source distribution
  during these steps, check if they work in any previous sections.

### Create a Docker distribution
1. Copy 'Dockerfile' and 'musclex.sh' to an empty folder from  biocatiit/musclex  
2. Build the Docker image: 
> docker build -t biocat/musclex . 
3. Upload the docker image to Docker-hub
> docker login --username=iitbiocat

> docker images

> docker tag be048eb52814 biocat/musclex:1-14.4

> docker push biocat/musclex

4. Test:
> musclex.sh

5. Record pip package versions:
> pip freeze > pipversions_1-14.4.txt
Copy this file into Documents/DevGuide/release-info

### Update documents in docs_archive
Create a copy of the current docs version in docs_archive and rename it as docs_versionNumber.

### Update documents
[Update docs for Read-the-Docs][4].

## Publish a Release
### Upload packages to SourceForge
Upload the installers for Windows and Mac OS X to the SourceForge repo.
See our [SourceForge repository][5]. Or use other tools for uploading
(see details [here][6]).

### Upload the project to PyPI
See [Uploading your Project to PyPI][7]. Be careful of this step, because
one version number are only allowed to be used once for uploading one
source distribution. 
> python setup.py sdist  
> twine upload dist/*  

### Publish the release on GitHub
Pubulish the release [here][8].

### Update the information of the new release on Zenodo
Edit [here][9]. **Authors** are generated according to contributors of
the GitHub repo. Change them properly according to [Project Credits][10].

### Create App Image using App Image Installer
- Place muscle/requirements.txt, musclex/musclex and musclex/musclex/main.py in musclex/AppImageBuilder Folder.
- Open terminal and run the following command
```
appimage-builder
```
- For additional details refer [here][11]
- pay attention to the PYTHONPATH in AppImageBuilder.yml, it varies depending on different python version.
